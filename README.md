StarStruck is an IOS reimplementation intended to learn about IOS/Starlet.  
It is based on mini, a bare-bones IOS replacement by Team Twiizers.  
It's goal is to fully replace IOS one day, but we are far away from our goal.  
StarStruck also has a goal to allow modules to be modular and replacable.  
This would allow certain modules to be able to be replaced by others.  
(e.g. ISFS module to be replaced with EmuNand)  
  
Please feel free to add code to fill in gaps in the functionality.  
As it stands, it's useful for low-level system access as it allows the PPC to have full access to the Wii's hardware.
